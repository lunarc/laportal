ARC Job Submission Tool - README
--------------------------------

This is the first official release of ARC Job Submission Tool
(arcjobtool) together with the ARC release.

The release should be considered experimental and need a lot
more testing before it is to be used in a production environment.

To add support for more application, the arcjobtool implements a 
plugin architecture for adding support for different runtime-environments 
and grid-applications. The documentation for this is not completed, but 
have a look in the plugins-directory to see some examples of how plugins can
be implemented in arcjobtool.

The release of arcjobtool also includes an initial attempt of creating
a GUI for requesting grid-certificates. I would like to have feedback
if this is a useful utility and if the implementation done in a
secure manner. The tool is implemented in approximately the same way
as the grid-cert-request script. 

Information on how to install the application can be found in the
INSTALL document.
